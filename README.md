# React Boilerplate

## Status
> WIP - not yet ready for public consumption!

## What is this?
A starting point for a web app built with Facebook's React.

The goal is to use [leading technologies](#tech) to build a solid seed project for developing web apps.

## Features
- User/pass token & cookie based authentication against a backend
- Routing between views (with URL changes)
- Clear separation of components

## <a name="tech"></a>Technologies
- React
- Backbone.Router
- Foundation
- jQuery.Cookie
- Lo-Dash
- MomentJS
- Gulp
- Bower


## Caveats
This is under **heavy development**.

I'm doing a lot of hacky/non-RESTful things to tie everything up to my backend at the moment, so I would recommend against anyone cloning this in it's current state.
